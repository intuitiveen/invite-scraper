<h1>Aurora Invite Scraper</h1>
<h2>If this helped you in any way, I would appreciate it if you starred this repository.</h2>
<br />
<p>A simple invite scraper that utilizes httpx and web scraping to scrape invites off the following sites:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://discordhome.com/" target="_blank">https://discordhome.com/</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://top.gg/" target="_blank">https://top.gg/</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://discord.io/" target="_blank">https://discord.io/</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://discord.st/" target="_blank">https://discord.st/</a></li>
</ul>
<br />
<h2>Run the program</h2>
<p>You can run this program multiple ways such as <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-python-script-to-exe-file/" target="_blank">converting the script to an exe</a> or running it in a python editor of your choice (I prefer PyCharm or VSCode).</p>
<br />
<h2>Authentication</h2>
<p>This project includes an authentication system. If you would like to remove aforementioned authentication system, simply delete the auth.py file located in the util folder along with the if statement that checks whether the authentication key is valid in index.py. If you would like to implement authentication using your own keys, you can visit <a href="https://keyauth.win/" target="_blank">KeyAuth</a> and set it up yourself.</p>
